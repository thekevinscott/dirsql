# Configuration File

> Online: <https://thekevinscott.github.io/dirsql/cli/config>

`dirsql` is configured with an optional `.dirsql.toml` file; with none, the
server falls back to [zero-config defaults](./server.md#defaults). A
[TOML](#toml) config is declarative: it defines filesystem-fact tables (the
path, glob captures, and stat metadata) and works with any installation.

## TOML

Reach for a TOML config — the default `.dirsql.toml` — to declare tables from
filesystem facts: a glob selects files, and columns come from path captures and
stat metadata. No code required, and it works with every installation.

### Basic Example

```toml
[dirsql]
ignore = ["node_modules/**", ".git/**"]

[[table]]
ddl  = "CREATE TABLE posts (_path TEXT, _basename TEXT, _size INTEGER, _mtime INTEGER)"
glob = "posts/*.md"
```

Each `posts/*.md` file produces one row in the `posts` table.

### Loading a Config File

The CLI loads `./.dirsql.toml` by default; pass `--config <path>` to point at
another file. To load the same `.toml` from the SDK, pass its path to the
`DirSQL` constructor:

::: code-group

```python [Python]
from dirsql import DirSQL

db = DirSQL(config="./my-project/.dirsql.toml")
await db.ready()
```

```rust [Rust]
use dirsql::DirSQL;

let db = DirSQL::builder()
    .config("./my-project/.dirsql.toml")
    .build()?;
```

```typescript [TypeScript]
import { DirSQL } from "dirsql";

// String argument is interpreted as a config file path.
const db = new DirSQL("./my-project/.dirsql.toml");
await db.ready;
```

:::

By default, the root directory scanned is the config file's parent
directory. Override it by passing `root` explicitly (the explicit value
wins and a warning is emitted) or by declaring `[dirsql].root` in the
config file itself.

### Root Directory

By default, the config file's parent directory is the scan root. To index
a different location, declare `[dirsql].root` (relative paths are resolved
relative to the config file's parent):

```toml
[dirsql]
root = "../data"
ignore = ["node_modules/**"]
```

### Stat Virtuals

Every config-defined table can expose any of these reserved columns. Add
the ones you want to your DDL; the rest are silently dropped.

| Column | Type    | Source |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `_path`     | TEXT    | The file's path relative to the scan root. |
| `_basename` | TEXT    | The filename including extension. |
| `_dir`      | TEXT    | The parent directory path (relative to root). |
| `_ext`      | TEXT    | The file extension, lowercased, no leading dot. |
| `_size`     | INTEGER | Size in bytes. |
| `_mtime`    | INTEGER | Last-modified time, unix seconds. |
| `_ctime`    | INTEGER | Created/changed time, unix seconds. |

Example query:

```sql
SELECT _basename, _size
FROM posts
WHERE _mtime > strftime('%s', '2024-01-01')
ORDER BY _mtime DESC;
```

### Path Captures

Use `{name}` in glob patterns to extract path segments as columns. Add a
matching column name to the DDL and the capture is auto-populated:

```toml
[[table]]
ddl  = "CREATE TABLE comments (thread_id TEXT, _basename TEXT, _mtime INTEGER)"
glob = "_comments/{thread_id}/*.jsonl"
```

A file at `_comments/abc123/2024-05-05.jsonl` produces a row with
`thread_id = "abc123"`, `_basename = "2024-05-05.jsonl"`, and `_mtime` set
to the file's modification time.

### Ignore Patterns

The `ignore` list skips files and directories entirely (not even scanned):

```toml
[dirsql]
ignore = ["node_modules/**", ".git/**", "*.pyc", "__pycache__/**"]
```

The top-level `.dirsql/` directory is always excluded, whether you list it
or not — it is a reserved namespace for `dirsql`'s own metadata (see
[Persistence](../guide/persistence.md)).

### Persistence

Set `persist = true` to keep the SQLite database on disk between runs
instead of rebuilding from scratch on every startup:

```toml
[dirsql]
persist = true
# persist_path = ".dirsql/cache.db"   # optional; this is the default
```

See [Persistence](../guide/persistence.md) for the full reconcile algorithm,
storage layout, and limitations.

### Loading extensions

You can load SQLite extensions by specifying them in a config.

Declare each extension as a `[[dirsql.extension]]` entry:

```toml
[[dirsql.extension]]
path       = "./ext/myext.dylib"
entrypoint = "sqlite3_myext_init"
```

- **`path`** — a path to the extension's shared library (`.so` / `.dylib` /
  `.dll`). Relative paths resolve against the config file's parent directory.
- **`entrypoint`** *(optional)* — the extension's init symbol. When omitted,
  SQLite derives a default from the filename; set it when that default does not
  match (for example, `sqlite-vec`'s entry point is `sqlite3_vec_init`).

**Note**: `dirsql` enables extension loading only while loading the configured libraries,
then disables it again, so `load_extension()` is not exposed via SQL to the user.

Extensions add **functions** you can call in queries and in a regular table's
DDL (defaults, generated columns). An extension-backed **virtual table** cannot
be declared as a `[[table]]` — `dirsql` tables are per-file row tables — so a
`CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE` DDL is rejected; call the extension's functions in your
queries instead.

### Strict Mode

By default, auto-injected virtuals that aren't in the DDL are silently
dropped, and undeclared user-extract keys are dropped. Enable strict mode
to error when an extract emits keys not declared in the DDL:

```toml
[[table]]
ddl  = "CREATE TABLE comments (thread_id TEXT)"
glob = "_comments/{thread_id}/*.jsonl"
strict = true
```

Strict mode does **not** apply to auto-injected stat virtuals — those are
always filtered to the DDL's declared columns regardless. Strict mode
applies only to keys produced by an extract callback (relevant for
programmatic [tables](../guide/tables.md)).

### Full Example

```toml
[dirsql]
ignore = ["node_modules/**", ".git/**", "dist/**"]

[[table]]
ddl  = "CREATE TABLE comments (thread_id TEXT, _basename TEXT, _mtime INTEGER)"
glob = "_comments/{thread_id}/*.jsonl"

[[table]]
ddl  = "CREATE TABLE documents (_path TEXT, _basename TEXT, _size INTEGER)"
glob = "**/index.md"

[[table]]
ddl  = "CREATE TABLE logs (_path TEXT, _size INTEGER, _mtime INTEGER)"
glob = "logs/*.csv"
```
